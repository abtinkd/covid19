# CovidAlert
Covid19 is the disease that is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Since its emergence in late 2019, it has affected many regions of the world, still there many other regions that are not infected yet. There is also a concern that those regions that could controll this epidemic, might face another spikes in the future. Physical interactions among people is one of the key factors. In this project we study the surge of covid19 cases in different regions of the world as well as the side of effect of mobility of communities on the resurgence of this virus.

There are two main datasets used in this project:
1) Time series of the covid cases provided by John Hopkins University;
2) Golbal mobility report made by Google.

There are a couple of challenges while working with these datasets:
1) Reported data in different parts of the world do not follow the same standard.
2) Comparing different parts of the world with each other is not practical. They have different population, population density, life expectency.

To deal with these challenges, I decided to use history of reports as an indicator for its condtions in the current time.
